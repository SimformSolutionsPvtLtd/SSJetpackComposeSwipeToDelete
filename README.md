## How to Use and Customization
1. Wherever you want to add swipeable view
```groovy
    SwipeAbleItemView(
            // Triplet(Icon, TintColor, Id) Pass the icon with the tint color which you want to display in left side view, Id will be used to identify onClick Events.
            leftViewIcons = arrayListOf(Pair(Icons.Filled.Edit, "btnEditLeft"), Pair(Icons.Filled.Delete, "btnDeleteLeft")),
            // Triplet(Icon, TintColor, Id) Pass the icon with the tint color which you want to display in right side view, Id will be used to identify onClick Events.
            rightViewIcons = arrayListOf(Pair(Icons.Filled.Edit, "btnEditRight")),
            // Position of the item normally required only when used with lazyColumns to identify the index of the item.
            position = 0,
            // Swipe direction it can be Left or Right or Both (Left + Right).
            swipeDirection = swipeDirection ?: SwipeDirection.BOTH,
            // Perform any action when swipeable view is clicked. It provides the position(Index of the item) as well as id to identify which item clicked incase of multiple items.
            onClick = { // Pair(Position, Id)
                Toast.makeText(context, "${it.second} clicked. Position :- ${it.first}", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
                    .show()
            },
            // Width for the left side of the view which will be shown when swiped.
            leftViewWidth = 70.dp,
            // Width for the right side of the view which will be shown when swiped.
            rightViewWidth = 70.dp,
            // Height for the swipeable view.
            height = 60.dp,
            // Background color for left view.
            leftViewBackgroundColor = Primary,
            // Background color for right view.
            rightViewBackgroundColor = Primary,
            // Corner radius for swipeable view.
            cornerRadius = 4.dp,
            // Space between left swipeable view and your main content view.
            leftSpace = 10.dp,
            // Space between right swipeable view and your main content view.
            rightSpace = 10.dp,
            // fractionalThreshold for the swipe
            fractionalThreshold = 0.3f
        ) {
           // Your main view comes here.
        }
